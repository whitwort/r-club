# Fitting models and basic statistics

More details coming soon, but here's the code we went over this week:

```{r}
# Load ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
# Generate some fake data
timePoints  <- 1:10
response    <- 1:10 * 10
plot(timePoints, response)
# Add some randomized jitter to our fake data
jitter    <- rnorm(10, 10)
response  <- (1:10 * 10) + jitter
d         <- data.frame(timePoints = timePoints, response = response)
p <- ggplot(d, aes(timePoints, response) ) + geom_point()
print(p)
# Fit a linear model: model response as a function of timePoint
fit <- lm(response ~ timePoints, d)
summary(fit)
coefficients(fit)
# Extract the intercept and slope parameters from our linear model fit
intercept <- coefficients(fit)[1]
slope     <- coefficients(fit)[2]
# Plot the model as an abline on top of our data
print(p + geom_abline( slope = slope
                     , intercept = intercept
                     , color = "lightblue" )
                     )
# Perform a one-way GLM ANOVA on the sample diamonds data set
ggplot(diamonds, aes( clarity, price) ) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(diamonds, aes( price, fill = clarity) ) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
a <- aov( price ~ color, diamonds )
print(a)
summary(a)
