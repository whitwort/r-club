# Fitting models and basic statistics

More details comming soon, but here's the code we went over this week:

```{r }
timePoints  <- 1:10
response    <- 1:10 * 10

plot(timePoints, response)

jitter    <- rnorm(10, 10)
response  <- (1:10 * 10) + jitter
d         <- data.frame(timePoints = timePoints, response = response)

p <- ggplot(d, aes(timePoints, response) ) + geom_point()
print(p)

fit <- lm(response ~ timePoints, d)
summary(fit)
coefficients(fit)

intercept <- coefficients(fit)[1]
slope     <- coefficients(fit)[2]

model <- function(t) { (slope * t) + intercept }
print(p + geom_abline(slope = slope, intercept = intercept, color = "lightblue" ) )

ggplot(diamonds, aes( clarity, price) ) + geom_boxplot()
ggplot(diamonds, aes( price, fill = clarity) ) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
aov( price ~ color, diamonds )
