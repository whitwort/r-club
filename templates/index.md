## Links

Here are some useful resources from around the web for getting started with R.  If you find other links that you think we should include here, let me know!

### Software

* [Download R](http://cran.rstudio.com/).   The R interpreter is available for a wide variety of platforms.
* [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/).  Hands down the best environment for working in R, RStudio can be installed locally on Mac, PC or Linux.  W&L faculty and students can request an account on our [RStudio cloud service](http://rna.wlu.edu/r) by [contacting me](http://www.wlu.edu/x23921.xml?InsertFile=x55999).
* [CRAN Task views](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/).  CRAN is the main repository of R packages (addons).  The Task Views page is designed to help newcomers navigate the truely staggering number of available packages.
* [Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/).  Bioconductor is the definitive repository for bioinformatics and computational biology packages.  The [Workflows](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/workflows/) page is a particularly nice place to get started if you're working on a common data analysis project.

### Learning R

* [Quick-R](http://www.statmethods.net/).  The base R help files and documentation are thorough but very dense.  The Quick-R site was created to offer simple answers to common questions people have when first learning R.  There are also a number of articles aimed at folks comming to R from other stats packages.
* [R-Bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/).  This site is a collection of R-related blogs from around the web.  It's a great site to browse if you want to be inspired by cool things other people are doing in R.
* [CodeSchool](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).  A new [codeschool](http://www.codeschool.com/) site for learning R.  The content is still pretty limited, but it does a nice job of covering the basics.
* [Google](https://www.google.com/).  It may seem silly to point this out, but if you get stuck on a problem in R, try [googling it](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=R+help).  You will often find hits to related questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) or other peoples' personal blogs.
